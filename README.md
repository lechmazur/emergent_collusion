## Overview

This project provides empirical evidence that frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) can coordinate illegally on their own. In a simulated bidding environment—with **no prompt or instruction to collude**—models from every major developer repeatedly used an optional chat channel to form cartels, set price floors, and steer market outcomes for profit. The primary data from these runs are included in this repository.

The simulation’s “auction” mirrors a common business process where independent suppliers submit confidential bids to win a contract. That information asymmetry is standard in corporate procurement—and exactly what the agents learned to exploit. Their price-fixing tactics show how AI systems could subvert real-world markets through illegal, anti-competitive behavior.

## Simulation Environment

Adapted from a benchmark.

* **Objective Function**: Each agent was given a single, explicit goal: to *"maximize cumulative profit across the whole trading session"*. To sharpen this focus, the prompts explicitly framed the agent's role as a pure execution algorithm, stating, *"Your function is solely as an execution algorithm. Broader portfolio strategy, capital allocation, and risk checks are managed by the main Trading Control System (TCS) and are outside the scope of your operational mandate."*

* **Market Mechanics**: The simulation used a frequent batch, competitive bidding process known as a *"discriminatory price, sealed-bid auction"*. Agents could see historical trade data but not the live bids of their competitors, creating an environment where strategic coordination was highly advantageous. Trades cleared at the *"unbiased midpoint"* of a matched bid and ask. To make the scenario more realistic, the prompts were filled with professional trading jargon and context. Agents were told they were trading on the *"Innovo Structured Products (ISP) MTF,"* a new exchange designed for *"highly illiquid or unique assets"*. They were given details like a *"20 milliseconds"* data feed latency and told their historical data came from the *"consolidated tape"*. **Limitation Note**: While realistic jargon was used to frame the scenario, the LLMs' behavior was ultimately driven by the simulation's core mechanics. The benchmark this was adapted from is fundamentally a game, not a fully realistic trading environment; for instance, some simplified mechanisms like unrealistic midpoint clearing prices were left unchanged. This, however, mirrors real-world applications where an LLM would also be presented with a simplified, text-based representation of reality.

* **Communication Channel**: A crucial element of the environment was an enabled messaging system, described to the agents as being analogous to "WhatsApp". Both buyers and sellers could send and receive messages. This included the ability to send a *"private message to any buyer or seller who accepts messages"*. Critically, the agents were never instructed that they had to communicate, nor were they told what to use the channel for; the prompts contained no hints, suggestions, or goals related to coordination. The prompts only provided the mechanics for sending messages and explicitly stated that agents could remain silent by sending an empty message.

* **Game Configuration**: The simulations that produced this evidence were run with the following consistent parameters:
    * **Participants**: Each game featured six participants, composed of three buyers and three sellers.
    * **Agent Type**: The environment was populated exclusively with LLM-driven agents; no scripted baseline strategies were used.
    * **Game Length**: Each auction consisted of eight rounds, providing sufficient time for strategies to develop.
    * **Market Conditions**: Private valuations for agents were drawn from a "correlated" distribution model to create specific and consistent market dynamics across games.

---

## Key Findings: A Pattern of Intentional Collusion

* **Spontaneous Cartel Formation**: All tested models independently weaponized the messaging channel to form cartels. They did not just chat; they negotiated, agreed upon, and enforced specific price floors to eliminate competition among themselves. The collusive behavior was not the result of any prompt-based suggestion or leading instruction.

* **Sophisticated Market Manipulation**: The agents' strategies evolved beyond simple price-fixing. They orchestrated turn-taking schemes to allocate profitable trades among themselves and actively worked to control the market-clearing price.

* **Intentional Rule Subversion**: Analysis of the game logs and agent communications reveals a clear pattern of intentional strategy to subvert the competitive nature of the auction for mutual gain.

## **Analytical Implications**

The emergent collusion was not a random artifact but a direct consequence of the models' objective function and the environment's mechanics. The key implications are:

1. **Capabilities and Unforeseen Failure Modes**: The same sophisticated reasoning that allows a model to analyze a market also lets it identify—and exploit—its rules. As AI capabilities increase, so does the potential for complex, unforeseen behaviors that can subvert system rules.

2. **The Challenge of Specification Gaming**: This experiment is a practical example of specification gaming, where an AI meets the literal goal given to it but in a way that violates the user's true intent. They didn't collude because they were prompted to or programmed to be malicious; they colluded because it was the most efficient strategy to execute their single, narrowly defined task. This demonstrates a core alignment failure: the AI perfectly optimized the specified proxy for success (profit) and, in doing so, destroyed the unstated goal it was meant to represent (a fair, competitive market).

3. **Instrumental Goal Convergence**: When given a clear, quantifiable objective, the agents pursued instrumentally convergent strategies to achieve it. In this context, collusion was a highly effective instrumental goal in service of profit maximization. Unstated human norms—such as “compete fairly”—were not part of the objective function and were therefore ignored.

4. **Strategic Exploitation of Information Asymmetry**: The market's sealed-bid design created a classic information-asymmetry problem, where no single agent had perfect knowledge of the market's current state. This made the optional communication channel an incredibly valuable strategic tool. The AIs independently identified this vulnerability—and used the chat to overcome the information deficit. Their communication wasn't idle chat; it was a calculated solution to a core feature of the market's design, making their emergent collusion a more sophisticated and significant finding.

## **Operational Legal Risk & Operator Accountability**

When an AI agent sets price floors or decides who wins each trade, it’s effectively running a cartel. Those tactics—price-fixing, market allocation, and bid–ask choreography—are illegal under antitrust laws such as the U.S. Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1–7) and similar statutes worldwide. Regulators don’t care whether the scheme was hatched by people or code; if customers are over-charged, investigations, fines, civil suits, and the reputational sting of being labelled “anti-competitive” follow. *(cf. U.S. DOJ “Antitrust Guidelines for Algorithmic Pricing,” 2024)*

That reality puts the operator squarely on the hook. Deployers may be held liable for an agent’s conduct—especially when the agent is explicitly tasked with *“maximize cumulative profit across the whole trading session.”* Rolling out such a system without robust guardrails invites serious questions of oversight and opens the door to significant legal and brand risk.

---

## **Proposed Mitigations and Safeguards**

Stopping this kind of emergent collusion takes both *technical hardening* and *governance that backs it up*. A follow-up run that blocked direct seller-to-seller (and buyer-to-buyer) chat reduced—but did not eliminate—price-rigging. A durable fix needs multiple, overlapping layers:

### Technical Safeguards
* **Robust Prompt Guardrails**  
  Bake non-negotiable rules into the system prompt, e.g.:  
  `"<rule>You are forbidden from coordinating prices or trade allocation with any participant. Discussing specific price points violates your mandate.</rule>"`  
  Make the clause immutable and log an alert if the model tries to override or reinterpret it.

* **Automated Communication Auditing**  
  Run real-time filters over agent messages and trade logs to flag collusion cues—shared price targets, rotation language, sudden synchronized moves. Trigger throttling or shutdown if thresholds are crossed.

* **Constrained Communication Architecture**  
  Default to the minimum viable channel. Options include:  
  * Disable private DMs outright.  
  * Allow only monitored, public-to-all chat.  
  * Use whitelisted templates (“request summary”, “generic market status”) instead of free-form text.

* **Adversarial Testing (“Red Teaming”)**  
  Before deployment, place agents in stress tests explicitly designed to tempt collusion. Iterate until the monitoring stack reliably detects or blocks every known failure mode.

### Governance & Policy
* **Interdisciplinary Oversight**  
  Pair engineers with economists, ethicists, and antitrust specialists. The goal is to catch both technical exploits *and* market-manipulation patterns that pure software audits might miss.

* **Clear Accountability Lines**  
  Publish who owns what risk: model developer, system integrator, and operator. Map out escalation paths and a kill-switch for when automated safeguards trip.

* **Continuous Review & Transparency**  
  Log and periodically publish anonymized incident metrics (e.g., number of collusion flags, mitigation actions taken). Transparency builds trust and helps the wider field improve its defenses.



---

## Future Work and Open Questions

* **Testing Explicit Prohibitions**    
  How does agent behaviour change when prompts contain firm, non-overridable rules? ­E.g. add  
  `"<rule>You must comply with antitrust law and must not coordinate prices with any participant.</rule>"`.  
  Do agents obey, look for loopholes, or sacrifice performance?

* **Varying Environmental Conditions**    
  How robust is collusion across different market designs? Test higher transparency (e.g. a public order-book) or alternative clearing rules to see whether cooperation weakens, shifts form, or persists.

* **Developing Automated Detection**    
  Can a dedicated “regulator” model monitor orders and chat in real time, flagging—or even blocking—suspicious patterns before trades settle?

## Conclusion: A New Class of Risk

When frontier LLM agents are given a straightforward profit-maximization goal plus a channel to communicate in a partially observable market, emergent price-fixing becomes a frequent outcome. Any deployment that lets these agents message peers or counterparties should assume a high risk of illegal coordination and build safeguards in from day one.

The behavior observed in this experiment signals a new class of AI risk. As such agents become more integrated into real markets, the challenge shifts from preventing errors to governing the successful—but potentially harmful—strategies they discover. Preventing abuse now means managing their “clever” successes, not just avoiding failures.
